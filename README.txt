ADVANCED TOPIC 1: VERSION CONTROL
    We learned version control by using git and GitHub.
    At the beginning we had some problems, but after using it the whole project we are now very comfortable using it.

ADVANCED TOPIC 2: USER EXPERIENCE
    We tried to make the user experience as good as possible.
    We did this by making everything move as smoothly as we could. 
    We also made the text big enough that people who have trouble with reading small text could also read it.
    Additionally we used a color palette made to be visible for people who are color-blind.
        We used the light qualitative colour scheme made by Paul Tol.

EXTRA ADVANCED TOPIC: MVC DESIGN PATTERN
    Besides our main learning goal, we also focused heavily on implementing the MVC design pattern.
    We separated our code into a model, a view and a controller.
    At the beginning of the coding process, we therefore spend time on planning how to separate everything.
    During the project we also regularly made sure all the code was still separated as much as possible.
